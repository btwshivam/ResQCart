Milk Spoilage Prediction and Price Engine
Key Points:

Research suggests ~16% of milk produced globally is wasted, with significant losses in the USA due to spoilage, overproduction, and consumer behavior.
Pasteurized whole milk tends to spoil more than skim or UHT milk due to higher fat content.
Spoilage is predicted using simulated pH, bacterial load, and days past expiry, with a dynamic price engine recommending sell, donate, or dump actions.
The system uses a FastAPI endpoint to process milk SKU inputs, simulate spoilage metrics, and provide pricing decisions for your teammates’ frontend.

Milk Spoilage in the USA
Approximately 16% of dairy products, including milk, are wasted annually, with the USA contributing significantly due to its high production (26.4 billion gallons in 2023). During the COVID-19 pandemic, 2.7–3.7 million gallons were dumped daily due to reduced demand, though typical annual spoilage is lower but still substantial, with consumer waste (e.g., due to misunderstood date labels) accounting for ~19% of dairy waste.
Types of Milk Prone to Spoilage
Pasteurized whole milk spoils faster than skim or low-fat milk due to higher fat content, which supports bacterial growth. Psychrotrophic bacteria (e.g., Pseudomonas) cause souring and curdling, especially in refrigerated storage. UHT milk has a longer shelf life due to ultra-high-temperature processing, reducing spoilage risk.
Prevention Methods

Proper Storage: Store milk at 0–4°C to slow bacterial growth.
Improved Packaging: Use light-blocking containers to prevent light-induced spoilage.
Bioprotective Cultures: Add cultures to inhibit spoilage bacteria.
Consumer Education: Clarify date labels to reduce premature disposal.

System Overview
The system accepts a milk SKU (e.g., “whole_milk_1gal”), simulates spoilage metrics (pH, bacterial load, days past expiry), predicts spoilage using a logistic function based on research, and applies a dynamic price engine to recommend actions (sell, donate, dump) with a message explaining the prediction.

Research suggests that approximately 16% of dairy products, including milk, are wasted annually, with the USA contributing significantly due to its high production of 26.4 billion gallons in 2023 .
Types of Milk Prone to Spoilage

Whole Milk: More prone to spoilage due to higher fat content (3.5–4%), which supports bacterial growth, particularly psychrotrophic bacteria like Pseudomonas that produce proteolytic and lipolytic enzymes .
Skim and Low-Fat Milk: Less susceptible due to lower fat content (0–2%), but still vulnerable to lactic acid bacteria causing souring (pH ~4.5) .
UHT Milk: Least prone due to ultra-high-temperature processing, extending shelf life to months .
Organic Milk: May spoil faster if not UHT-treated, as it lacks preservatives and has higher microbial loads from natural production.

Causes of Spoilage

Bacterial Growth: Psychrotrophs (e.g., Pseudomonas, Bacillus) grow at 0–7°C, producing enzymes that degrade proteins and fats, leading to souring, curdling, and off-odors .
Storage Conditions: Temperatures above 4°C or light exposure accelerate spoilage .
Contamination: Post-pasteurization contamination from equipment or packaging introduces spoilage bacteria .

Prevention Methods

Refrigeration: Store at 0–4°C to inhibit psychrotrophic bacteria .
Light-Blocking Packaging: Use opaque containers to prevent light-induced degradation .
Bioprotective Cultures: Add cultures to suppress spoilage bacteria .
Consumer Education: Clarify “sell-by” vs. “use-by” labels to reduce premature disposal .

Milk Spoilage Prediction
The system simulates spoilage metrics for a given milk SKU (e.g., “whole_milk_1gal”):

Days Past Expiry: 0–14 days, reflecting shelf life impact.
pH: 6.4–6.6 (fresh), 4.5–5.5 (spoiled), as lactic acid bacteria lower pH .
Bacterial Load: 2–8 log CFU/mL (fresh), 8–10 log CFU/mL (spoiled), based on microbial growth models.
Storage Temperature: 0–10°C, affecting spoilage rate.

Spoilage is predicted using a logistic function:
$ P(\text{spoiled}) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-(w_1 \cdot \text{days} + w_2 \cdot \text{pH} + w_3 \cdot \text{bacterial\_load} + b)}} $

Weights ($w_1=0.5$, $w_2=-1.0$, $w_3=0.8$) and bias ($b=-5.0$) are derived from research on microbial spoilage dynamics .

Price Engine Logic

Base Price: $3.45/gallon (2023 average, Statista).
Fresh Milk (probability < 0.5, days past expiry < 2): Sell with 0–10% discount.
Mildly Spoiled (probability 0.5–0.7, pH ≥ 5.0): Sell with 20–50% discount.
Severely Spoiled (probability > 0.7, pH < 5.0): Donate if bacterial load < 9.0 log CFU/mL, else dump.
