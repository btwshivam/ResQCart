# ResQCart: Food Waste Prediction & Rescue Network

## üéØ Executive Summary

**Problem Statement:** Walmart loses $1.8B annually due to food waste, while 38M Americans face food insecurity. Current markdown systems are reactive and inefficient, leading to massive waste and missed revenue opportunities.

**Solution:** AI-powered predictive system that forecasts product expiration 3-7 days in advance, automatically triggering a cascading rescue protocol through dynamic pricing, community partnerships, and employee programs.

**Impact:** 40% reduction in food waste, $720M annual savings, 50M meals redirected to food banks, enhanced brand reputation as sustainability leader.

## üß† Technical Architecture

### Core AI Engine

**Predictive Models:** Multi-variate time series analysis combining:
- Historical sales velocity data
- Product-specific shelf life algorithms
- Environmental factors (temperature, humidity)
- Seasonal demand patterns
- Local event impacts (sports games, holidays)
- Weather correlation analysis

**Real-time Data Integration:**
- IoT sensors on shelves and storage areas
- POS system integration
- Inventory management system feeds
- Supply chain logistics data
- Customer traffic patterns

### Automated Rescue Protocol (ARP)

**Day 7-5 Before Expiry: Predictive Early Warning**
- AI identifies at-risk products
- Automated inventory rebalancing between stores
- Supply chain adjustment recommendations

**Day 4-3 Before Expiry: Dynamic Pricing Activation**
- Automatic 15-30% price reduction
- Customer app notifications to nearby users
- Targeted digital coupons for relevant customers

**Day 2-1 Before Expiry: Community Rescue Mode**
- Instant alerts to partner food banks
- Employee purchase program activation (50% discount)
- Bulk sale opportunities to local restaurants/caterers

**Day of Expiry: Final Rescue Attempts**
- Flash sale notifications (70% off)
- Community pickup alerts
- Compost/recycling program routing

## üìÅ Project Structure
